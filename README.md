How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Maintining working code is difficult but if kept readble adaptable and maintainable. The struggle is worth it in the end.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

When approaching problems, I try to break things down into smaller more managable problems and try to take down the more difficult ones from there.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Like most other scientists they solve problems in reguards to their field, if they were a server person they would solve issues that servers might be haivning for the companey that employed them.
