# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Maintaining the working code is difficult but if kept readable adaptable and maintainable. The struggle is worth it in the end. CRUD will be useful for my work in my current field as I am maintaining a few spreadsheets/databases of my own for my team and regular updates help us help others.

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

When approaching problems, I try to break things down into smaller more manageable problems and try to take down the more difficult ones from there. My problems are more spelling for this class, if you are not careful and misspell something, the code won't work, or will not know where to look. 

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Like most other scientists solving problems is part of the job. You have to look at it from a critical thinking point and have good problem-solving skills for starters. It's also good to have easily moldable code for future use or to implement for other needs, and making it legible is a good idea too so that you know what you are working with.
